# Console-Finances

## Description

A Javascript console application that will produce output from the contents of two arrays. The challenge for week 4 of the bootcamp.

This application aims to emulate a real world application that receives input in the format of a 2-dimensional array and produces output that is meaningful to the end user (e.g. numerical data and information)

I engaged with this project as it was an opportunity to identify ways to mathematically manipulate array data and present them in a functional way for the end user.

While building this application, I have learnt about two-dimensional arrays and how to call on information from them, how javascript processes mathematical functions, and how to troubleshoot when the application does not behave as expected, by changing elements to identify which part of the application is responsible for the unpredictable output.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![Open application on Browser](img/Instructions1.png)
    ```

    ```md
    ![Right Click and Select: "Inspect"](img/Instructions2.png)
    ```

    ```md
    ![Select Console on the tabs on the right side](img/Instructions3.png)
    ```

    ```md
    ![See the console output on the right side](img/Instructions4.png)
    ```

Tests Peformed:
Array calculated separately in Microsoft Excel to establish accuracy of numbers. When numbers at Excel and Console did not match, code was ran in small portion of array. Bug was identified as a mathematical error as minus symbols in deduction cancel out and produce inaccurate results. After research, I used the "parseInt" function to perform additions of numbers.
