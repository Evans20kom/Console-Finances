# Console-Finances

## Description

A Javascript console application that will produce output from the contents of two arrays. The challenge for week 4 of the bootcamp.

This application aims to emulate a real world application that receives input in the format of a 2-dimensional array and produces output that is meaningful to the end user (e.g. numerical data and information)

I engaged with this project as it was an opportunity to identify ways to mathematically manipulate array data and present them in a functional way for the end user.

While building this application, I have learnt about two-dimensional arrays and how to call on information from them, how javascript processes mathematical functions, and how to troubleshoot when the application does not behave as expected, by changing elements to identify which part of the application is responsible for the unpredictable output.

## Usage



Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.

Tests Peformed:
Array calculated separately in Microsoft Excel to establish accuracy of numbers. When numbers at Excel and Console did not match, code was ran in small portion of array. Bug was identified as a mathematical error as minus symbols in deduction cancel out and produce inaccurate results. After research, I used the "parseInt" function to perform additions of numbers.
