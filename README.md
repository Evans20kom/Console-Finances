# Console-Finances

## Description

A Javascript console application that will produce output from the contents of two arrays. The challenge for week 4 of the bootcamp.

This application aims to emulate a real world application that receives input in the format of a 2-dimensional array and produces output that is meaningful to the end user (e.g. numerical data and information)

I engaged with this project as it was an opportunity to identify ways to mathematically manipulate array data and present them in a functional way for the end user.

While building this application, I have learnt about two-dimensional arrays and how to call on information from them, how javascript processes mathematical functions, and how to troubleshoot when the application does not behave as expected, by changing elements to identify which part of the application is responsible for the unpredictable output.

## Usage

When you open the deployed application [here](https://github.com/Evans20kom/Console-Finances), a blank page will appear that prompts you to look in the console window:
    
    ![Open application on Browser](img/Instructions1.png)
    
Right click on the page and click "inspect". Alternatively, press F12 on your keyboard.
    
    ![Right Click and Select: "Inspect"](img/Instructions2.png)
    
On the right hand side, you will see a new window. Find the tab that writes "console" at the top, and click on it.
    
    ![Select Console on the tabs on the right side](img/Instructions3.png)
    
You can see the output of the application on the console window on your right, under the console tab.

Tests Peformed:
Array calculated separately in Microsoft Excel to establish accuracy of numbers. When numbers at Excel and Console did not match, code was ran in small portion of array. Bug was identified as a mathematical error as minus symbols in deduction cancel out and produce inaccurate results. After research, I used the "parseInt" function to perform additions of numbers.
