Identified name of array in starter code here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array

Looked for details on two dimensional arrays and code here:

Found how to add within an array here:

Tests Peformed:
Array calculated separately in Microsoft Excel to establish accuracy of numbers. When numbers at Excel and Console did not match, code was ran in small portion of array. Bug was identified as a mathematical error as minus symbols in deduction cancel out and produce inaccurate results.
